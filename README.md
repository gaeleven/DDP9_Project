# DDP9_Project
View a working demo of the sequencing report [here](https://gdscan-gaeleven.shinyapps.io/rawcode). The code for the sequencing report integrates the strengths of R for data analysis.

The data are the report of a RNA-seq sequencing for 78 samples of humans, sheeps, pigs and cows. This samples has differents status (a treatment given or not). 

The global objective of the project is to explore the difference between genes expression for individuals treated and untreated individuals.

The main visualisation summary include this sequences metrics :
* Visualisation thought number of sequences
* Visualisation thought mean size

The main visualisation summary include this individuals metrics :
* Visualisation thought single sample
* Visualisation thought strain (human, sheep, pig, cow)
* Visualisation thought status (treated/not treated)

Barchart graph is generated with rcharts R library and nPlot function.

Barchart can be visualize in vertical or horizontal mode (radiobutton option)
